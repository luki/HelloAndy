# HelloAndy

## Story
This app is nothing spectacular and no constraints have been set either. The purpose of this project was entirely understanding
the IDE, which is Android Studio, and also to the language. 

## Further Story
My first 'confrontation' with Kotlin was back in May of this year, you can find the regarding repository 
[here](https://github.com/luki/kotlin-start).
